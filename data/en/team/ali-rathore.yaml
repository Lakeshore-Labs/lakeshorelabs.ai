# About Section

  title: "About Ali Rathore"
  headline: "Founder & CTO Building AI-Native Solutions"
  
  bio: |
    After two decades architecting systems that scale from startups to Fortune 500s, I founded Lakeshore Labs to solve a critical gap: most companies know AI will transform their industry, but they don't know where to start or how to execute.
    
    We're not another consultancy selling PowerPoints. We build production AI systems that actually ship. From autonomous agents managing 700+ vehicle fleets across Southeast Asia to RAG systems processing millions of enterprise documents, our implementations drive real revenue and cut real costs.
    
    My journey from UC Berkeley EECS through Silicon Valley engineering leadership taught me that the best technology means nothing if it doesn't solve business problems. That's why we focus on pragmatic AI—systems that work today, scale tomorrow, and deliver ROI from day one.
